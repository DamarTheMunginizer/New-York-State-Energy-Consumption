## 6. Conclusion & Strategic Recommendation

The costs of solar and wind energy have dramatically decreased in recent years, and with federal incentives like the **30% ITC for solar** and the **\\$25 per MWh PTC for wind**, these technologies present a highly cost-effective option for large-scale energy projects. Hydropower remains a reliable option where geography permits, but solar and wind energy offer the fastest cost reductions and scalability.

Given the long-term environmental and economic benefits, including job creation and energy independence, transitioning to renewable energy is a strategic move for the state. By taking advantage of financial incentives, the state can make a significant investment in clean energy while reducing future energy costs.

**Recommendation:** Pursue large-scale investments in solar, wind, or hydropower to drive sustainable growth, energy security, and job creation for the state. The continuing price reductions in renewable energy makes this an opportune time for investment.
