## Overview
According to the [New York State Energy Plan](https://energyplan.ny.gov/), the State of New York intends to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 85% of their 1990 levels by 2050. To this end, the State must produce and maintain renewable energy infrastructure to gradually replace the existing carbon-based energy systems in place on a similar, if not accelerated, timescale. In particular, the various climatological zones of New York State are amenable to wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. In order to determine the best locations for each source of energy, we must consider a variety of factors, from typical weather to cost to land use agreements.

We employ k-means clustering and time-series analysis to classify the state into distinct climatological zones, so that we might simplify the process for the State Energy Planning Board to determine which land use agreements should be considered for each type of renewable energy source. We then perform a predictive time-series analysis to demonstrate that our proposed plan will continue to serve the State into the near future, in alignment with the state's benchmark goals in 2030.

## Data Dictionary
We collect weather data over a 20-year period from 2005 to 2024 using the [open-meteo api](https://open-meteo.com/). Open-meteo collects daily weather data at 05:00 GMT. In addition, we've collected energy consumption data for the State of New York from [New York Independent System Operators](https://www.nyiso.com/) and population data from [New York State's public data respository](https://data.ny.gov/Government-Finance/Annual-Population-Estimates-for-New-York-State-and/krt9-ym2k/about_data).

## Requirements

### Hardware
The time-series K-Means model is parallelized on 12 threads as written. We recommend that a prospective colleague or student seeking to replicate this work either operates on a machine or server with a CPU that has **at least** 6 cores and 12 threads or modifies the `n_jobs` argument to a lower number. The latter option will increase the computation time significantly.

## Executive Summary

### Purpose
We require three key pieces of information in order to best inform the Energy Planning Board of the best regions to considering building solar, wind, and hydroelectric energy collection facilities and distribution centers:

- The climatological regions of New York State
- The demand for energy across the State
- The cost of building and maintaining said structures

To determine the climatological zones and the source of energy to which they are most amenable, we employ k-means clustering and time-series k-means clustering, both to inspect the number of zones and how those zones might change over time.

### Data Handling
#### Weather Data
We gathered daily weather data for the 20 year period spanning 2005 to 2024, across 166 distinct points from New York State from the Open-Meteo API. We discovered after-the-fact that weather data from 2011 onward was only available for a single point, but had operated under the assumption that we had more complete data.

The UV data we collected was completely missing. As such, we opted to remove it. Likewise, two points were missing sunshine duration data. Given that the rows with missing data were so small relative to the overall dataset, we opted to remove these as well.

All of our data presented as "object" types in our pandas dataframe, though all of our data was numeric or a "datetime" in nature. We manually adjusted the datatypes to account for this, which is reflected in the data dictionary above. Since the weather data was collected at the same time everyday, we opted to remove the timestamp at the end of every date.

After checking for correlations between the native features of our dataset that remained, we engineered some additional features, which are made plain above. We also consolidated the precipitation sum into a single feature, since the distinct type of precipitation does not have an impact on the viability for solar or hydroelectric power.

#### Load Data
The load data required less transformation in the same sense as the weather data. We gathered data for the energy load from NYISO by zone, then converted the zone-based data by county, accounting for the population of each county. The process to collect the load and population data required building an ETL pipeline for each one, since the data was saved in smaller chunks by non-standard denominations. You can view both pipelines within the code folder.

### Analysis
We initially intended to divide New York State into three clusters: one for each energy source we considered to be compatible with the State. A quick k-means clustering algorithm demonstrated that a hydro-electric cluster is not well-defined, thus we focus on solar and wind. With that knowledge in mind, we engineered a few features to improve the separation between clusters, which are clearly indicated above. We then project all of our features through 2030 using a Prophet model (which handles seasonality, trends, and shocks with ease) before fitting a time-series k-means clustering model to it. We see that our clusters shift as time progresses, relative to the 2020 clusters, but we should note that the Open-Meteo data is faulty on collection. As such, our analysis may need to be revisited with more complete data.

We also projected New York State's energy use through 2030 with a Prophet model. Here the data was more complete and required no feature engineering and our projected data aligns very well with historic changes. We see that the State's energy consumption drops over time, with seasonal upticks during the Summer months. We would expect energy consumption to taper at some point, however our projections show it completely vanishing, which is unrealistic. This is one of the faults with time-series analysis.

As the energy consumption for the State drops, the cost of energy production would as well, as some solar and wind farms can be retired. Our cost analysis is purely based on research in public-facing figures from The United States Department of Energy, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, The International Renewable Energy Agency, and the United States Energy Information Agency. We do expect that the cost for maintaining solar and wind farms will be impacted by inflation, but not enough to offset the savings presented by the lower cost of use.

### Findings and Implications
Our present analysis suggests that New York State is in a great position to take advantage of wind and solar farms to produce and store energy to service the whole State's needs. The construction, staffing, and maintenance of these new facilities is projected to produce around 250,000 new jobs and save the State trillions in the long term, compared to the present energy infrastructure. As the effects of human-accelerated climate change become more visible, the climatological zones of New York State will muddle as well, with the "solar" zone growing larger.

### Next Steps
Future work would confirm that our proposal accurately assesses and meets New York's energy needs through 2050 and beyond. We do caution, however, that long-term time-series projections tend to be unreliable, though there is a margin of confidence we may able to provide. The New York State Energy Planning Board should proceed to check land use agreements in accordance with our recommendations.
